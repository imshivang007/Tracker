# Vehicle Tracker

A simple real-time vehicle tracking system using Node.js, WebSocket, and Leaflet.js. This project simulates the movement of a vehicle on a map and updates its location in real time using OpenStreetMap tiles.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates a real-time vehicle tracking system where the location of a vehicle is updated on a map every 2 seconds. It uses **WebSockets** to send real-time data between the server (backend) and the client (frontend). The frontend is powered by **Leaflet.js**, which displays an interactive map using **OpenStreetMap** tiles.

You can extend this project to track actual vehicle data by connecting to a real-time GPS data source or API.

## Features

- Real-time vehicle location updates using WebSockets.
- Interactive map using **Leaflet.js** and **OpenStreetMap** tiles.
- Responsive, minimalist design with black-and-white color scheme.
- Animated header for a sleek and modern user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend for serving the app and WebSocket communication.
- **WebSocket**: For real-time vehicle location updates.
- **Leaflet.js**: JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
- **OpenStreetMap**: Free map data for display on the frontend.
- **Express**: Simple Node.js framework to serve static files.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic front-end for displaying the map.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14+ recommended)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

### Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vehicle-tracker.git
   cd vehicle-tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the server**:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

4. **View the app**:

   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the map with the vehicle marker.

## Usage

- The app simulates real-time vehicle movement by randomly adjusting the vehicle’s latitude and longitude.
- The frontend listens to WebSocket messages from the server to update the vehicle’s position on the map every 2 seconds.

## Deployment on Render

You can easily deploy this app on Render using the following steps:

1. **Push your code to GitHub**.
2. **Sign up for Render** at [Render.com](https://render.com).
3. **Create a new Web Service** and connect your GitHub repository.
4. **Configure the service**:
   - **Build Command**: `npm install`
   - **Start Command**: `node server.js`
5. Once deployed, Render will provide a public URL where your app can be accessed.

### Important: WebSocket URL
If Render provides a unique domain, make sure to update the WebSocket client URL in your `public/index.html` file:
```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket('wss://your-app-name.onrender.com');
```
